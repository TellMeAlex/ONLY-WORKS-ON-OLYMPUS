=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Configuration Validator
Workspace: managed by orchestrator
Started: 2026-02-18

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: This is a new feature being added to an existing single-service plugin. It requires adding a new validation module, CLI command, and integration with the existing config loading system.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Created project_index.json
- Created context.json
- Created init.sh
- Created build-progress.txt
- Phases: 4
- Total subtasks: 14

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1: Validator Core Module - 5 subtasks, depends on []
- Phase 2: Validator Tests - 5 subtasks, depends on [phase-1-validator-core]
- Phase 3: CLI Integration - 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-1-validator-core]
- Phase 4: Integration - 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-2-validator-tests, phase-3-cli-integration]

Services Involved:
- olimpus: TypeScript/Bun plugin for oh-my-opencode meta-orchestration

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Recommended workers: 2
- Parallel groups:
  * phase-2-validator-tests + phase-3-cli-integration (both depend on phase-1, different domains)

Key Findings from Investigation:
- Zod v4 schema validation already in place at src/config/schema.ts
- MetaAgentRegistry in src/agents/registry.ts has circular dependency detection methods
- Builtin agent names defined in BUILTIN_AGENT_NAMES constant
- Bun test framework used for testing
- No existing CLI commands in project - need to add bin/ directory

Acceptance Criteria from Spec:
- [ ] Validates all configuration fields against Zod schema (already done in loader.ts)
- [ ] Detects circular dependencies in meta-agent delegation chains
- [ ] Verifies all agent references exist in the oh-my-opencode registry
- [ ] Warns about potentially slow regex patterns
- [ ] Integrates with CLI as 'olimpus validate' command

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  cd /Users/alejandro/dev/ONLY-WORKS-ON-OLYMPUS/.auto-claude/worktrees/tasks/003-configuration-validator && bun run .auto-claude/specs/003-configuration-validator/init.sh

Then run the orchestrator:
  python auto-claude/run.py --spec 003 --parallel 2

=== END SESSION 1 ===

Session 2 (Implementation):
- Subtask-2-3: Write tests for agent reference validation
  - Status: Tests already present in src/config/validator.test.ts (lines 377-684)
  - Coverage: checkAgentReferences (8 tests), checkAgentReferencesInConfig (4 tests), createInvalidAgentReferenceError (1 test)
  - Tests follow scaffolder.test.ts pattern with Arrange-Act-Assert structure
  - Updated implementation_plan.json: subtask-2-3 status changed from "pending" to "completed"
  - Committed: 52a3ccf
