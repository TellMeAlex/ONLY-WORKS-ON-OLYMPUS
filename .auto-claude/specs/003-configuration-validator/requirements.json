  "task_description": "# Configuration Validator\n\nSchema-based validation tool that checks configuration files for errors, circular dependencies, invalid agent references, and other common mistakes. Provides clear, actionable error messages.\n\n## Rationale\nAddresses configuration complexity issues common across competitors (pain-1-3, pain-3-1). LangGraph and AutoGen users struggle with configuration errors that are difficult to debug. Pre-validation catches errors before runtime.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a developer, I want to validate my configuration before starting a session so that I avoid runtime errors\n- As a new user, I want clear error messages that help me fix configuration mistakes\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Validates all configuration fields against Zod schema\n- [ ] Detects circular dependencies in meta-agent delegation chains\n- [ ] Verifies all agent references exist in the oh-my-opencode registry\n- [ ] Warns about potentially slow regex patterns\n- [ ] Integrates with CLI as 'olimpus validate' command\n",
